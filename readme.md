## How to Use
Run rs-stereo.py to run our stereo visual odometry program. An intel d-435 camera needs to be plugged into the computer.

Run plot_result.py afterwards to visualize the tracked trajectory

Run rs-ukf.py to visualize our UKF only. As the sensor rotates, so should the drawn coordinate frame.
